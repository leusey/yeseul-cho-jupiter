        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a first generation Korean American immigrant and a UC Berkeley graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology. My passion lies in understanding human behavior and creating meaningful solutions. My experiences range from conducting research on health disparities and emotional functioning to tutoring over 200 students worldwide in English, honing my communication and adaptability skills. Currently, I am learning to code at Code the Dream and working toward a career in the tech industry, where I aim to combine human-centered design with technological innovation. I am also deeply committed to community service and advocacy, and I strive to bring creativity, empathy, and a problem-solving mindset to everything I do.</p>
